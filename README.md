My name is Vanessa Liu - a 4th year student currently studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo.

:fire: I've been trying to learn new things so that I can create personal projects. It's been super interesting and I'm eager to continue the learning journey!

:musical_keyboard: When I have the time, I like to jam on the piano or use Garageband to record songs :notes:

:art: With a passion for art brewed from childhood, I love sketching, painting and working with designs and illustrations using traditional and digital media! :pencil2:

:camera: I also love documenting special moments and capturing experiences through photography and a bit of vlogging as well :sunglasses:

:envelope: I'm always excited to make new connections, so feel free to reach out to me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/vanessa-liu014/
