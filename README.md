:fire: I've been trying to learn new things so that I can create personal projects. It's been super interesting and I'm eager to continue the learning journey!

:musical_keyboard: When I have the time, I like to jam on the piano or use Garageband to record songs :notes:

:art: With a passion for art brewed from childhood, I love sketching, painting and working with designs and illustrations using traditional and digital media! :pencil2:
